## Have you noticed that every other website today looks... the same?

Hero image, big headline, some cards with icons, neat sections, muted gradients — and boom, you’re done. Scroll through enough portfolios, agency pages, or startup landing sites, and it’s like déjà vu on repeat. Even personal blogs look like they were born from the same mold.

I’ve been thinking about why. And more importantly — what we’re losing.

## The AI Web Is Fast. But Also Kinda... Average.

Let’s get this straight — I love building websites. It's part craft, part puzzle, part storytelling. And yeah, AI tools like Wix ADI, Framer’s AI, or even Notion’s new site generator are amazing at speed. You give them a prompt, and *bam*, you've got a site with smart spacing, good contrast, modern fonts — the whole deal.

But here’s the thing: it’s *too* good. Like, suspiciously good. It’s trained on thousands of top-performing websites, finds common patterns, and spits out something that’s basically the "most-likely-to-convert" version of a site. And that’s the problem. It's like the AI is taking a massive average of the entire Internet’s design language and serving us a distilled, neutral, inoffensive result.

Kind of like what happens when you average faces.

## The ‘Average Face’ Effect — But for Websites

There’s this psychological thing I saw in a [YouTube video 🔗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwKlvd8BaxY) — the idea that the most attractive faces are the most **average**. Not extreme. Just perfectly balanced, symmetrically safe, and... well, forgettable.

That’s what AI is doing to websites.

By learning from everything, it creates a generic “face” for the Internet. And that face is clean, functional, and deeply uninspired. The soul is gone.

## Let’s Time-Travel Back to the Pre-2000 Web

If you're too young to remember or haven’t done a deep scroll through [oldweb.today 🔗](http://oldweb.today/) or the Geocities archive, please do yourself a favor and explore it. The pre-2000s Internet was unhinged. And I mean that in the best way possible.

- Neon backgrounds that could blind a bat.
- Spinning “under construction” signs.
- MIDI music autoplaying.
- Comic Sans paired with glowing red headlines.
- Hit counters like some badge of honor.
- Webrings.
- Pages about everything and nothing.

It was wild. It was ugly. It was glorious.

Each site felt like someone’s personal bedroom wall. Not optimized. Not polished. But real.

That era *let people be weird*. There were no design standards, no rules. It was digital chaos, and that chaos made the Internet *feel alive*.

## What We’re Losing with AI

When we let AI build our websites from the average of everything, we’re giving up a lot:

### 1. **Identity**

Your site isn’t just a place with links — it’s your fingerprint. The AI-generated stuff? It’s more like a clone with your logo slapped on it.

### 2. **Cultural Flavour**

Most AI tools are trained on Western design norms. As a result, regional styles, cultural quirks, and design choices that don't “convert” in Silicon Valley get filtered out. That’s erasure, not elevation.

### 3. **Permission to Experiment**

If AI always tells us “what works,” we’ll stop trying new things. And the web stops evolving.

You know how Spotify algorithms push you toward the same 5 artists that “match your taste”? AI site builders are doing the same thing to design.

And look, I get the efficiency angle. Not everyone wants to code a website from scratch. But even if you use AI, *you’ve got to fight for the flavor*. Treat its output as the base — not the final form.

## How We Keep the Web Weird (In a Good Way)

- **Customize your AI output**. Don’t just click "publish." Tweak it. Add weird scroll effects. Use an unusual typeface. Bring in your culture.
- **Support indie designers** who dare to go beyond the safe defaults. The ones who still design like it’s 1999.
- **Push AI tools to train on diverse data** — not just conversion-optimized UIs, but also glitch art, old forums, Japanese blogs, Tamil meme pages, whatever. The Internet is big. Let it *be* big.

## In the End, the Web Reflects Us

The web is one of the most powerful human inventions. It’s supposed to be chaotic, emotional, expressive, and free. If we let AI smooth out all the edges, we’ll wake up one day and realize every site looks the same, every voice sounds the same, and we’ve accidentally created the most boring version of ourselves.

Let’s not let that happen.

Let’s make room for messy websites, for offbeat design, for under-construction signs and music that autoplays and scrollbars that blink.

Let the web be human again.
